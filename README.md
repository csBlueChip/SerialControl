# Serial Command & Control System
This library implements an intuitive command system for controlling your Arduino from your PC. Most people will probably use the built-in Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE, but any other programs (such as PuTTY) are equally as valid.
It is simple to configure, implements a full HELP system and comes with a simple example to remotely control control and LED.
